//TODO FIX SPELLING
Now code to: (all separate things)

start service in background
    
    that stays alive with a watchdog AlarmResciver
    watches for foreground activity to change, Knows its package name.
    launch app(amazon launcher home screen) --https://github.com/butzist/ActivityLauncher.


Now I need to put them together to make a parental control app that can make use of code base included in forked code from https://github.com/butzist/ActivityLauncher.

need to incorperate blacklist/whitelist, populate ViewGroup of installed apps, like already done in MainActivity https://github.com/butzist/ActivityLauncher, In my own ways, using their methods for getting info on activitys, and starting them.


This repo is an intermedate project, It will be merged into https://github.com/Kapcode/Android-Parental-Controls at end. That is the plan in the end anyways.
